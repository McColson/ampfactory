Amp Factory
===========

Amp Factory is a collection of free (as in "free speech", not "free beer") electronic schematics for tube amplifiers dedicated to guitar and bass.

A-wai Amplification
-------------------

The documents in the "a-wai" directory are the schematics for amplifiers manufactured by A-wai Amplification, a one-person company building handwired amplifiers in Toulouse, France.

These schematics are licensed under the terms of the version 3 of the GNU General Public License. Therefore, you are granted the right to use, modify and/or redistribute these documents under certain conditions, listed in the GNU General Public License (see LICENSE file or the GNU website at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/).

The schematics are offered in two file formats :
- a .pdf for easy viewing and printing
- a .jsch file, which you can edit using the JSchem free software (http://dhost.info/jschem/)

Contributed schematics
----------------------

The "contrib" directory holds the schematics for amplifiers not manufactured by A-wai Amplification.

These schematics are the property of their respective owners, while still being offered under the terms of a free software license.

In that respect, they are also provided in a printable pdf version, as well as an editable version.

Non-free schematics
-------------------

Finally, the "non-free" directory holds a collection of schematics gathered from the web. These schematics are only available in printable form, and you cannot modify these files.

How to contribute
=================

You can send me your schematics to :

Please be aware that any contribution has to relate to an amplifier already built and proven to work as expected, and be offered under a GPL-compatible license, in both printable and editable file formats.

There may be a few exceptions regarding very rare amplifiers which would present a particular interest from a technical point of view, but they must be strictly considered this way -- exceptions.
